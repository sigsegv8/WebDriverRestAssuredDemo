# WebDriverRestAssuredDemo

A sample test automation framework using Selenium and RestAssured with TestNG. This project will demonstrate the following:

- Fluent Interface with Selenium Web Driver
- RestAssured with Plain Old Java Objects (POJO) serialization and de-serialization for a RESTful API call
- Using TestNG to run both examples in one suite

Configuration:

The only configuration required is found under the src/main/resources folder config.yaml, simply enter your valid chromedriver path here and then run 'mvn clean install' in terminal to execute all tests. You can also import as a Maven Java project in your favourite IDE and execute tests from there.

For Upgrade SDET take home interview test.
